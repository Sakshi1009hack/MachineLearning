Basic of numpy, pandas and matplotlib

1)	Numpy :- 
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.
NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

Why Use NumPy?
In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.
Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

2)	Pandas : -
Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008
Why Use Pandas?
Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
Relevant data is very important in data science.

3)	Matplotlib :- 

Matplotlib is a low level graph plotting library in python that serves as a visualization utility.
Matplotlib was created by John D. Hunter.
Matplotlib is open source and we can use it freely.
Matplotlib is mostly written in python, a few segments are written in C, Objective-C and Javascript for Platform compatibility.
